### Cupcakes

This exercise creates an api using Flask for adding, updating, and deleting cupcakes in a database.

The front-end page uses JavaScript and axios to get the cupcakes in the database via the api, and a form rendered with WTForms to add cupcakes ot the database.

The seed.py file may be run to add two sample cupcakes to the postgresql database 'cupcakes'.

Running the tests requires a database named 'cupcakes_test'.
